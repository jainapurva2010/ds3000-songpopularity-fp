# ds3000-songpopularity-fp

This repository contains the dataset used to create a regression model to assess the impact of various musical attributes on song popularity, and determine if these features could be used to predict how well-known a song could become. It also contains screenshots of three graph visualizations (using the seaborn and plotly express libraries in Python) from the data exploration step of the project, each displaying how a particular attribute is correlated to song popularity.
